To get your extension working, you need to create an icon file at:

client/public/icons/icon48.png

Follow these steps:
1. Open the icon48_instructions.html file in your browser
2. Right-click on the image and select "Save image as..."
3. Navigate to the client/public/icons folder
4. Save it as icon48.png

This will provide the required icon file referenced in the manifest.json.

The issue you're experiencing ("טעינת התוסף נכשלה") is due to:
1. Missing index.html file (which I've now created)
2. Missing or empty icon files (we need to save it from the instruction HTML files)

Once you save the icon, the extension should load properly in Chrome.
